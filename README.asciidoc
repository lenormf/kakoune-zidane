kakoune-zidane
==============

This project implements a small Github plugin for
https://github.com/gawel/irc3[irc3], and a configuration file that sets up
an IRC bot to run on https://github.com/mawww/kakoune[Kakoune]'s channel.

Instructions
------------

Setup
~~~~~

Python 3 is required to run the bot.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lenormf/kakoune-zidane.git
$ cd kakoune-zidane
```

The recommended way to run the bot is by setting up a virtual environment,
but this step is optional:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file, either manually
or using the `pip` package manager:

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a dedicated access token on your https://github.com/settings/tokens[Github profile], and grant it the following permissions:

* `public_repo`

Once successfully created, declare this token (which should be kept secret)
in the bot's configuration file:

```ini
# zidane.cfg

[github_plugin]

token = <token>
```

In order to enable debug messages on the console, add `debug = true` in
the above section.

Tweak other `irc3` settings if necessary.

Running
~~~~~~~

Use the following command to start the bot:

```sh
$ irc3 zidane.cfg
```

Refer to the documentation of `irc3` to learn more about additional flags
(e.g. `-d` for debugging).
